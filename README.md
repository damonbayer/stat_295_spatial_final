# Predictors of Test Positivity and Mortality During Four Waves of the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic in Orange County

This repository contains the code and [final report](bayer_damon_stat_295_final.pdf) for my final class project for  STATS 295 - Spatial Analysis.

This analysis aims to expand the investigation presented in [Parker 2021](https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2710.210103) while accounting for spatial correlation and to further evaluate heterogeneity in test positivity and death rate at later stages in the epidemic.
