              large population center in southern California, USA (Orange
              County, population 3.2 million), to determine heterogeneity in
              risks for infection, test positivity, and death. We used a
              combination of datasets, including a population-representative
              seroprevalence survey, to assess the actual burden of disease and
              testing intensity, test positivity, and mortality. In the first
              month of the local epidemic (March 2020), case incidence
              clustered in high-income areas. This pattern quickly shifted, and
              cases next clustered in much higher rates in the north-central
              area of the county, which has a lower socioeconomic status.
              Beginning in April 2020, a concentration of reported cases, test
              positivity, testing intensity, and seropositivity in a
              north-central area persisted. At the individual level, several
              factors (e.g., age, race or ethnicity, and ZIP codes with low
              educational attainment) strongly affected risk for seropositivity
              and death.",
